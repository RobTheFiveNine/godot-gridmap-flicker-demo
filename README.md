# GridMap Flicker Bug Demo
This project is for demonstration purposes to show the bug in issue 79081 and to show a solution / workaround

## Controls
The project will launch into a scene containing overlapping geometry which will replicate the issue. Hitting the `tab` key will toggle anti-aliasing on and off to demonstrate how this can help mitigate it.

Pressing `space` will switch to a scene containing no overlapping geometry which will not have any flickering. Pressing `space` again will return to the initial scene.
